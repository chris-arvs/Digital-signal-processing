Ex 1: A : a custom convolution function was created to convole 2 linear,discrete time,finite sequences. x =u[n] , y = (1/2)^n.
      B : an example to prove that convolution in time = multiplecation in frequency
      
Ex2: singal x(t) = 5 cos(24*pi*t)-2sin91.5*pi*t), 0 < t < 500ms
            X(F) is calculated
            Sampling of signal is taking place with : a ) Ts = 1/48s , b) Ts = 1/24s , c) Ts = 1/12s.
           
Ex3: A) given x(t) = 10cos(2*pi*20t) - 4sin(2*pi*40t+5),128 samples was taken.
     B) x[n] = sin*(2*pi*fo*t + φ) 8000Hz, φ=30
        Ts = 1/Fs , x[n] = x(n/fs)
        f0 gradually raised from 100 to 475Hz and from 72525 to 7900 Hz
